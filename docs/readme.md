# Netlog Documentation

Netlog is design to be a Syslog-NG to MySQL parser with no-nonsense frontend.
Its goal is to provide a simple, effective and quick navigation through the
hosts that send syslog messages over the network. It has some features that 
can enrich your monitoring and logging.

The original source code previous to the 'v2.01' release, was not created by
me. Its source is yet to be verified though a good guess is there who stood
at the base of this project.
